  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I am a Data Analytics student with a strong interest in solving business
    problems using data. I enjoy working with messy datasets, identifying
    patterns, and transforming insights into decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am currently focused on strengthening my skills in SQL, Power BI, Python,
    and applied statistics while building practical, real-world projects.

  <p>
    This portfolio reflects my learning journey and the projects I am
    continuously improving as I grow as a data analyst.
