    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I am a Data Analytics student with a strong interest in solving
      business problems using data. I enjoy working with messy datasets,
      identifying patterns, and presenting insights through dashboards
      and reports.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently focused on strengthening my skills in SQL,
      Power BI, Python, and applied statistics while building
      practical, real-world projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      This portfolio reflects my learning journey and the projects
      I am continuously improving as I grow as a data analyst.
