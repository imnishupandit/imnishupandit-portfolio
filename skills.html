    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I am a Data Analytics student with a strong interest in solving business
      problems using data. I enjoy working with messy datasets, identifying
      patterns, and transforming insights into meaningful decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently focused on strengthening my skills in SQL, Power BI,
      Python, and applied statistics while building practical, real-world
      analytics projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      This portfolio reflects my learning journey and the projects I am
      continuously improving as I grow into a confident data analyst.
